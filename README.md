### Continued development

A company needs to introduce a responsive layout for profiles so that each user may customize their own card. They also want to use a card component as an interface for this feature.

**front end design only**

The first step is logging in to the system with a username and password. The login request is sent to the backend and then returns with information about the logged-in user. The app then stores that information about the user for later use in the app.

After logging into the system, users are able to change their profile picture. Upon hovering over "Profile" at the top of the screen, a menu appears that allows users to toggle between personal information (name, email, etc.) or changing their profile picture. Upon clicking "Profile" on this menu, they are directed to a screen where they can upload their latest photo or select one from their stored camera roll. Once they have chosen what they want.
